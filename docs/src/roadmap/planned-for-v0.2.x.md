# Planned for v0.2.x

## Model identification

It is planned to add parametric models such as ARX, OE or ARMAX.

## Controller

It is planned to add the terminal ingredient on the model predictive control.

## Export

It is planned to add the capability to export a model, a controller or a dashboard. The model and controller export should be simulable on Modelica or Simulink.

## Python API

It is planned a Python api.

## Matlab API

It is planned a Matlab api.

## Use case

It is planned to develop a number of case studies of dynamic system identification and energy system control, such as:
