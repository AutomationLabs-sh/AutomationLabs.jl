## What is AutomationLabs?

AutomationLabs is a low-code solution that provides the automation engineer with the necessary tools and algorithms. Such as store dynamical system data, plot data, dynamical system identification, tune optimal controllers based on Model Predictive Control.

## What does it contain?

AutomationLabs gives you advanced tools and algorithms and database to keep your valuable data, a large choice of models to efficiently model your dynamical systems, and also the possibility to model dynamical systems with physical equations. In addition, a number of models are based on artificial intelligence, allowing you to get powerful models. Moreover, we know that the difficulty does not lie in the models but in the algorithms and learning methods to properly parameterize these models. To do so, it offers the use of different optimization and learning algorithms. Thus, performance comparison is facilitated. In summary, it contains:

* Store, manage and plot data.
* Tune blackbox or greybox models for dynamical system identification.
* A large choice of models and optimization.
* Tune a Model Predictive Control.

## Why to use it?

AutomationLabs allows you to reduce engineering time, save time, and evaluate different models and control with a reduced code solution. In addition, the open-source solution prevents vendor lock-in and an easy-to-use api.
